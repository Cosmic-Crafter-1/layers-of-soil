Added dinosaur bones.

Make sure the bones come up with the layer and add animation to it. Optimize the sounds and models and reduce size.

Just thought about it, like going in front and showing a layer and coming back, is JUST ANIMATING THE CAMERA's position lmao. 

Added camera animation and narration.

-- Noticed that if I switch tabs / go to another app and come back, the sound is playing but animation is paused (because three.js does it auto). [Gotta fix it later.]

-- Noticed that colors on Amoled display pops out too much. On PC brown looks perfect, but on mobile it's messed up. [Gotta fix it later.]

27/02/12 -
-- Noticed that if I click on the animateCamera button twice, the animation plays out twice. [Fixed using a counter].

28/02/12 - 
-- Noticed code is getting too big. Time to organize.
