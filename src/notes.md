Added dinosaur bones.

25/02/12 - 
Make sure the bones come up with the layer and add animation to it. Optimize the sounds and models and reduce size.

26/02/12 - 
Just thought about it, like going in front and showing a layer and coming back, is JUST ANIMATING THE CAMERA's position lmao. 

Added camera animation and narration.

Noticed that if I switch tabs / go to another app and come back, the sound is playing but animation is paused (because three.js does it auto). Gotta fix it later.
